# 960 Aspen Drive

## Pros

* Kitchen layout
* Large fenced in yard
* Centrally located and quick access to the highway

## Cons

* I don't know how I feel about tile in the living room
* Listed for 309.9k, 2018 tax assessment 230.8k, seems like it might be the most expensive property on the street.

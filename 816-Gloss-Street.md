## Pros

* Location is familiar and decent schools
* Nice neighborhood
* Porch and overall curb appeal
* Kitchen and dining area are nice and open
* Backyard is nice
* Sun room is cool
* Deck is nice


## Cons

* I get the feeling from the stones in the backyard and the missing grass insinuate that water/mud might be an issue. or it could just be because of the tree shade.
* 10k drop in price as of 12/11
* Listed for sale on 9/24/2019 @ 309k then removed on 10/3/2019, then relisted 12/2/2019 @ 314.9k. Makes wonder me if it went under contract and it fell through for some reason.
